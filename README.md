aw-server-rust
==============

A reimplementation of aw-server in Rust

Primary features missing:
- Most transforms for query2 to be useful
- Config
- Import/Export HTTP api
- CORS

Caveats:
- Lots of refactoring is needed, code is far from good looking (especially query code)
- Lots of TODO and FIXME comments

Features missing compared to aw-server python and won't be reimplemented:
- Swagger support
